Now that I'm using HubPress for my blog, I have to work with link:http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html[AsciiDoc]. Coming form MarkDown, I was used to just putting raw HTML in a paragraph whenever I wanted to. This doesn't work in AsciiDoc; entities are being converted. But, as it turns out link:http://mrhaki.blogspot.nl/2014/06/awesome-asciidoc-include-raw-html.html[the solution is straightforward], wrapping code in four plus signs,

----
++++
<p style="color:red">This is red</p>
++++
----

will result in:

++++
<p style="color:red">This is red</p>
++++

Sweet, easy enough!
