As some of you may know, link:/2015/03/09/Mud-Masters-Haarlemmermeer-2015.html[I qualified for the OCR World Cup] earlier this month, which will take place the 17th and 18th of October in Cincinatti. Now that I have a new domain and a new blog backend, what
better way to keep up my "write more" intentions than write about OCR related stuff leading up to the event?

So, starting today, I'm going to write about everything training and OCR related that I find interesting enough. This means people could follow what's going on (hi mum, dad), but perhaps more importantly it'll be a sort of diary / reference for myself later, which can be fun or useful to read
back. I've been getting more and more questions lately about how I train and what I eat (even from strangers, I know right?), so if
there's anything I find worth mentioning in that area I'll write it up as well. Also, there might be some stuff about the developments
around link:https://twitter.com/swagmennl[Team Swagmen], a newly founded team of (OC) runners I'm a part of.

The first upcoming event: link:http://www.strongviking.nl/[Strong Viking] Mud Edition, tomorrow! The weather is shitty (as it should be)
and the link:http://obstakels.com/2015/03/27/parcoursverkenning-strong-viking-mud-edition/[course is going to be brutal],
but I've got my Under Armour tights and a plate of pasta, so let's go!

PS. I'll still be writing about tech/programming stuff occasionally, so don't get confused or put off by that ;).
