Hey, I'm Elte.

I don't know who you are, so I don't know how to describe myself to you.

If you're into sports, I'm the dude that loves to run, climb obstacles, and lift weights. I love it so much in fact that you may have noticed I'm listing this first. I think it's because it keeps me sane. Don't tell anyone.

If you encountered my name in a more "professional" context, well, that's possible too. I have a passion for technology and I've been writing code in some form or another since I was about 10 years old, when I was building and maintaining the website for my football club. I'm sure the site's visitors had to endure a lot of `<marquee />` and XSS-vulnerable PHP chat boxes during that time, but hey, people weren't _that_ familiar with the internet so it was all good.

Since then I've worked with a long list of languages and technologies, including but not limited to PHP, Java, C#, Python, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, .NET, Xamarin, Android, iOS, PyTorch, Ember.js, CakePHP, AWS, all kinds of version control on every one of the major three operating systems. That order, by the way, was kind of random. Honestly I'm not particularly attached to any of these technologies. With the correct motivation you can build good products in any of them. The experience may be all over the spectrum of "pleasant" and I'm all for trying the new things, but if your product is around long enough to be successful, parts of it becoming legacy is a fact of life.

I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Amsterdam, and a master's in Computational Science from the joint UvA / VU program. Currently I'm employed at [SRXP][srxp], actually I've been there for over 10 years, as part of the original technical team. In that context I've filled all possible roles, frontend, backend and APP developer, as well as working with some of my more recent interests, data science and deep learning.

Finally, I also like playing guitar and singing. It has been on the back burner for a few years, because life gets busy, and some times if you want to do things right it means you have to let other things go. Nevertheless I thoroughly enjoy picking up a guitar and singing my lungs out, and if the day had an extra hour that's probably how I'd be spending it.
