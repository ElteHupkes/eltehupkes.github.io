This week I started my master's in Computational Science at the University of Amsterdam. 
It's been two years and a half since I've taken any classes - my last uni-related 
activity was my link:https://github.com/ElteHupkes/ScoreFollower[thesis] which I finished
back in June 2012, and the last CS course took place half a year before that.

After a year of nothing but work, I'm curious how it's going to be!
