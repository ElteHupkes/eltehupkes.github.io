After running a homemade static CMS system for a while, I found that the threshold for adding blog posts using it was just slightly too high (which can easily be seen from the number of posts that have actually been added over time). I am therefore switching to a much simpler though slightly experimental system: link:http://hubpress.io[HubPress], a system allowing you to write your posts directly on GitHub Pages. 

I'll be porting posts over in the coming weeks and will report on how I like it.
