        <div class="paragraph">
<p>This week I started my master&#8217;s in Computational Science at the University of Amsterdam.
It&#8217;s been two years and a half since I&#8217;ve taken any classes - my last uni-related
activity was my <a href="https://github.com/ElteHupkes/ScoreFollower">thesis</a> which I finished
back in June 2012, and the last CS course took place half a year before that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After a year of nothing but work, I&#8217;m curious how it&#8217;s going to be!</p>
</div>
