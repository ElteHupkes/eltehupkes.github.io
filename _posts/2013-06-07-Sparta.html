<p>I don&#8217;t mind injuries. I mean I do, obviously, nobody likes being in pain; but I think getting injured is an intrinsic
part of sports, an inevitibility when you&#8217;re touching the boundaries of what you can and cannot do. During the twenty-two
years my life has occupied thusfar I&#8217;ve taken a few hits; hurt my ankle a couple of times, sprained my hamstrings,
probably some other stuff as well. Never like this torn ACL though. You see, all my previous injuries I have somehow
managed to recover from by myself.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>My friends and I have an inside joke (one I&#8217;ll take no credit for) whenever we see something or someone
deformed: "In ancient Sparta&#8230;&#8203; they&#8217;d have just thrown it off a rock." And now
I kind of feel like I deserve to be thrown off that rock. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll ever fully recover from this, but if it
wasn&#8217;t for medical science I could be sure that I wouldn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s probably just the crappiness of not being able to
walk regularly for three months talking - but I feel like my stubbornness has finally failed me.
It makes me feel weak. I&#8217;ve never felt weak before.</p>
