        <div class="paragraph">
<p>Last Wednesday I gave a short introductory talk about the Ember.JS app we have developed at <a href="https://www.srxp.com">SRXP</a>. There wasn&#8217;t much in the talk itself, though it sparked sort of a discussion on ember-cli (transitioning to it in particular). I figured I&#8217;d share the slides I used anyway, they can be found <a href="https://github.com/ElteHupkes/ember-meetup-srxp-showtell">here on GitHub</a>. To actually go through them you can use <a href="http://rawgit.com/ElteHupkes/ember-meetup-srxp-showtell/master/index.html">this rawgit link</a>.</p>
