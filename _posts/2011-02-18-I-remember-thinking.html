<p>&#8230;&#8203;wow, that&#8217;s like, basic probability theory! I am so doing this right. And so, I switched.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Context: I dreamt I was in a game show. The host looked like the voiceover guy from one of those old
computer racegames: large round glasses, thick curled chestnut brown hair; didn&#8217;t have to hear him speak to
know he was probably an asshole. I was given a choice of three doors: waiting behind one of them was a life without sorrow.
After picking a door the host would be so kind to point out one door that did not hold the candy, after which I&#8217;d
be allowed to switch. Classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, I did it right. As right as theoretically possible. But that cheating bastard of a
host picked the right door himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"You might just have made the right decision, why take that chance?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Heaven forbid I&#8217;d ever win something inside my own head.</p>
</div>
