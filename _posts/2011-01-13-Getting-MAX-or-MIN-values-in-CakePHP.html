        <div class="paragraph">
<p>This is something that always bugs me because I always have to look it up, and it isn&#8217;t really documented somewhere.
Building an aggregate query isn&#8217;t all that difficult:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-php" data-lang="php">$result = $this-&gt;find('first',
	array(
		'fields' =&gt; array('MAX(some_field) AS name')
	)
);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But even though it&#8217;s simple I keep forgetting how to actually get that value from the array.
Well, here it is (and now that I posted it here, I&#8217;m probably not going to forget it anymore..):</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-php" data-lang="php">$maxValue = $result[0]['name']</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
