        <div class="paragraph">
<p>Today I finished the first implementation of a workaround for something that has been bothering me for
quite a while: the absence of query parameters in <a href="http://emberjs.com">Ember.js</a>. I could write a lot
about it here, but I already have - on GitHub :). So without further adue,
<a href="https://github.com/ElteHupkes/ember-query-params">my Ember.js query parameter workaround</a>!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Update</strong> Query parameters have been fully integrated in the Ember.JS core for a while no, so luckily there is no more need for this library.</p>
