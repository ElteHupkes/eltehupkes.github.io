<p>I still have limited mobility, the thing (still thing - not yet knee) constantly feels weird
(not painful - weird), but my list of possible exercises is expanding to include even some things that
have the potential to get me tired and thereby raise my
endorphin levels. The next milestone should be cycling outside, which would solve pretty much all my transportation
problems here in the comparatively small city of Amsterdam. I&#8217;m hoping this won&#8217;t take more than a few weeks.</p>
