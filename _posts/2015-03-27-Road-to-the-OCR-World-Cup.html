<p>As some of you may know, <a href="/2015/03/09/Mud-Masters-Haarlemmermeer-2015.html">I qualified for the OCR World Cup</a> earlier this month, which will take place the 17th and 18th of October in Cincinatti. Now that I have a new domain and a new blog backend, what
better way to keep up my "write more" intentions than write about OCR related stuff leading up to the event?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, starting today, I&#8217;m going to write about everything training and OCR related that I find interesting enough. This means people could follow what&#8217;s going on (hi mum, dad), but perhaps more importantly it&#8217;ll be a sort of diary / reference for myself later, which can be fun or useful to read
back. I&#8217;ve been getting more and more questions lately about how I train and what I eat (even from strangers, I know right?), so if
there&#8217;s anything I find worth mentioning in that area I&#8217;ll write it up as well. Also, there might be some stuff about the developments
around <a href="https://twitter.com/swagmennl">Team Swagmen</a>, a newly founded team of (OC) runners I&#8217;m a part of.</p>

<p>The first upcoming event: <a href="http://www.strongviking.nl/">Strong Viking</a> Mud Edition, tomorrow! The weather is shitty (as it should be)
and the <a href="http://obstakels.com/2015/03/27/parcoursverkenning-strong-viking-mud-edition/">course is going to be brutal</a>,
but I&#8217;ve got my Under Armour tights and a plate of pasta, so let&#8217;s go!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>PS. I&#8217;ll still be writing about tech/programming stuff occasionally, so don&#8217;t get confused or put off by that ;).</p>
